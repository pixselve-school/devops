## ü§î What is ImgBot?

It's a helpful **automation tool** that **reduces the file sizes of your images** while maintaining their quality, ultimately saving you time. 

Once you have installed ImgBot, you will receive a pull request containing your optimized images. **Merging the pull request is all that is required**. 

As you continue working on your project, ImgBot will remain active, continuously optimizing your images. 

ImgBot utilizes **lossless compression by default**, ensuring that you only gain from using it. However, if you desire to save additional space, you can modify ImgBot to use lossy compression.


# üì¶ Installation

This bot utilizes the [GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace) model. You can install it on your organization or a single repository.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can configure ImgBot by creating a `.imgbotconfig` file in the root of your repository as a JSON file.

Here are the available options (all are optional):

| Name                  | Description                                             | Default | Type       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| schedule              | The frequency at which ImgBot will run.                 | `daily` | `daily` or `weekly` or `monthly` |
| ignoredFiles          | A list of files to ignore.                              | `[]`    | `string[]` |
| aggressiveCompression | Use lossy compression.                                  | `false` | `boolean`  |
| compressWiki          | Compress images in the wiki of the repo.                | `false` | `boolean`  |
| minKBReduced          | Delay new prs until size reduction meets this threshold | `10`    | `number`   |
| prTitle               | The title of the pull request                           | ...     | `string`   |
| prBody                | The body of the pull request                            | ...     | `string`   |


Here is an example of a configuration file:

```json
{
    "schedule": "daily",
    "ignoredFiles": [
        "*.jpg",
        "image1.png",
        "public/special_images/*",
    ],
    "aggressiveCompression": "true",
    "compressWiki": "true",
    "minKBReduced": 500,
    "prTitle" : "Your own pr title",        
    "prBody" : " Text before optimization ratio {optimization_ratio} Text after optimization ratio\nText before optimization details {optimization_details} Text after optimization details"
}
```

# üìù Usage

Once ImgBot is installed, it will automatically optimize your images through a pull request. 

### Lossless Compression

Here is an example of a pull request created by ImgBot:

<img src="./docs/imgbot/pr.png" width="500">

This example used lossless compression, which is the default setting. If you want to use lossy compression, you can modify the configuration file. The total savings is currently 18.07%.

### Aggressive Compression

If you want to save even more space, you can modify the configuration file to use lossy compression.

With the following `.imgbotconfig` file:

```json
{
    "aggressiveCompression": "true"
}
```

Here is the result:
