# Introduction

Bots in Software Engineering are becoming progressively inevitable because they allow us to automate and perform repetitive and pre-defined tasks.  

They can be judged in terms of autonomy, intelligence, interactivity, environment and objective. They can help the development teams with coding, testing, respecting the DevOps philosophy, supporting, documenting and collaborating.

These bots allow developers to enhance their efficiency and effectiveness.

The bots we used and described during this project are mostly bots helping with coding, collaboration and DevOps. We used Dependabot, Renovabot, Repairnator and ImgBot (a special bot that optimizes images).
